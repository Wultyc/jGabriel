### About the project name
The name Project Butterfly was chosen by the students, and it intends to express the symbolism that an internship has for students who initially go through this whole learning process (butterfly larva) that in the future will become engineers (butterfly) and will go through a process adaptation to their new reality (metamorphosis).
