<!--more-->
The Microwells project was a project developed during the first semester of the third year of the degree in the course of Systems Laboratories 2. It consisted of a device capable of communicating with several vital signs meters and sending that information to an online storage service.

During the project the following elements were built:
- Cardiac pulse meter: implementation of the measurement circuit and treatment of the analog signal in pair with a microcontroller (arduino) for data communication via usb.
- Microwells Box: communication interface between the meter and the cloud service.
- Microwells Cloud: Online record storage service.
