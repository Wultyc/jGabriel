During the second semester, there was a subject named Process Modeling and Simulation where the goal was to understand the main concepts of simulating processes.
As part of the signature program, a simulation project was required and the chosen theme was the boarding process on an airport. The project took place between May 2022 and July 2022 and had the collaboration of my collage Nuno Dinis.

The project had the following requirements:
* Building a simulation engine from scratch
* The engine needed to be decoupled from the events
* Easily adding new events
* Being able to adjust simulation paraments to run different sets and compare results


The final result is now public available in [GitHub](https://github.com/Wultyc/ISEP_2122_1A2S_MOSIP)
