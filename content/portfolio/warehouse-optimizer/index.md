The Warehouse Optimizer project was developed in two phases during the first semester of the second year of the degree. The first phase took place at the Operational Research corrective unit and consisted of developing a mathematical model that calculates the best route for an AGV to collect products from a warehouse and implement this model in Excel with the help of Solver. The second phase took place during the corrective unit Laborat√≥rios de Sistemas and consisted of building a java application to manage a warehouse and using the same mathematical model in AMPL to apply the changes defined by the model's response in the internal data structure of the application.
