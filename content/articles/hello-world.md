Hi, I'm a programmer born in Porto. During my childhood I had the opportunity to have contact with technology and that made me want to start developing software very early.
The first code I wrote was HTML (still in the time of HTML 4) with 13 years old. I went after a schoolmate who made a website for my class and I remember getting curious and starting to try to find out more about making websites. At the time, I used a Magalhães 2 computer. Maybe that's why I still prefer to work on small computers today.

Later, when I was 14 years old, I started studying PHP, because I wanted to make my sites more dynamic and after a short time I was responsible for maintaining the class website.
Two years later I decided that I wanted to learn a lower level programming language in order to understand programming concepts more deeply. It was then that I started to study C. However, I had already discovered another passion: Linux!
I met Ubuntu in 2012 and in that same year I abandoned Windows 8 to start using Ubuntu 12.04. Since then I have been increasing my knowledge both in programming and in linux operating systems.
I currently use Windows 10 but I haven't lost my connection to Linux systems. I don't have a favorite, I use them all. Each one in the role that makes life easier for me.
I currently work with Mulesoft (an integration platform built in Java), but I keep my personal projects in other technologies mainly PHP and Laravel.

### My Setup
My setup is really simple. Basically it is my Asus Zenbook UM433A r7 ultrabook with an AMD Ryzen 3700U 16GB of DDR4 ram and a 500GB NVME SSD.
In it I have Windows 10 Pro in the latest version and several virtual machines with Linux systems such as Ubuntu 20.04 (Desktop and Server), CentOS 7 and 8, RedHat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. My favorite code editor is Visual Studio Code and to do the versioning of the source code of my projects I use GIT assisted with Git Bash for Windows. To learn more about my projects, visit my [Github profile](https://github.com/wultyc) or the [Projects](/project) page of this website.

My hobbies today are to study about different technologies, mainly open-source, and to implement those same technologies personal projects in addition to 3D printing.

See you soon. A hug.
